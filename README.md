# OverPlate

OverPlate is a local co-op cooking game made in Unity as a custom final project for CIS27 at Laney College. It is inspired by games like Overcooked! and PlateUp!

## Features

- Up to 4-player local co-op (keyboard + gamepads)
- Players can join or leave at any time
- Pick up and combine ingredients to make dishes
- Use appliances like cutting boards and stoves to refine food
- Score increases when dishes are delivered
- Score is saved to a file and loaded when the game starts again
- Simple pause menu with resume and quit options

## How It Works

Players move around the kitchen, interact with objects, and combine items using a recipe system. Objects highlight when looked at. All gameplay is managed through Unity scripts using raycasting, player input, and object tagging.

## Future Plans

- Add more dishes and levels
- Add an order system with timers
- Improve graphics, animations, and sound
- Add a title screen and level selection
- Expand save data (e.g. player names)
